We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation dilemmaâ€¦ We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this: we want to share the love so nobody feels left out!

You can contribute to the documentation by [raising an issue to suggest an improvement](https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/issues/new) or by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/compare) on [our repository for documentation](https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs).

The current documentation is generated with:

- [reStructured Text (RST)](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org).

Other dependencies include:

- [Python 3.5 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads)

- [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx)

More information about contributing to the documentation, instructions on how to install the dependencies, and how to generate the files can be obtained [here](https://github.com/ctrliq/warewulf-docs/blob/master/README.md).

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the [section on contributing to the code](contributing). The procedure is identical for contributions to the documentation and the code base.
